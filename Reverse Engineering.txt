Shinigami👻: Hola Connnections & Particpants this is the file u looking for to decode your 4th digit of your Secret Key!!!
	   
Shinigami: 👻Sounds boring ha?? Don't worry here below is my friends 👻Aloha and 👻Yoko who will tell u what to do and how to do

Clue🦉: Sometimes its better if just Carefully Listen in a conversation!! So no issues or problems arises!!

Aloha: "I came across this string of letters, but something about it feels backward."

Yoko: "Backward, you say? Perhaps you should look at it from a different perspective. What if what’s last is first🧐?"

Aloha: "Hmm, reversing the usual order... So, A isn't where it starts🦉🦉?"

Yoko: "Indeed, the end is the beginning. But that's only the first step. Each letter hides its own value."

Aloha: "Once I reveal their values, what do I do with them🧐🧐?"

Yoko: "Numbers are fickle. They like to come together, but when they get too large, they split apart I mean I would just sum apart until He becomes a Single Like me😔.
       You must take care to handle them wisely🦉."

Aloha: "So, I need to combine these values somehow... But if the result is too big?"

Yoko: "Then let the digits speak separately. Only when they merge into a single voice will the true key be revealed. But remember, even the smallest misstep could lead you astray."

Aloha: "This sounds tricky... I suppose the string  🫠'MYSTERYS' 🫠 might hold some secrets. I’ll have to decode it carefully."

Yoko: "Yes, 'MYSTERY' indeed. But don’t rush. Think carefully at each step, for the correct path is often hidden within the obvious. When you’re done, and if your numbers are right, the answer will be a single digit. Only then will the key be in your grasp."


So that's it I am making it simple for finding the 5th digit just goto the File 🧐"Challenge the Warrior"
