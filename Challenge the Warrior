Challenge: Find the 5th Digit of the Key 🔢🗝️
	
	Welcome to the next challenge in our CTF event! 🎯🏆 Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to unravel the mystery hidden within a labyrinth of C code 💻🧩. The program you're about to encounter is a tangled web 🕸️ of functions spread across multiple sections 📜, each calling the next in a seemingly endless loop of confusion 🔄🌀.

To find the 6th digit of the key, you'll need to solve the entire program 🔍. But beware ⚠️! The code is designed to mislead and perplex 🧐, with circular dependencies ♾️ and hidden logic 🤯 that will test your debugging skills to the limit 🛠️💥. Only those with a keen eye 👀 and sharp wit 🤓 will be able to piece together the puzzle and extract the final digit 🧠🔢.

Are you ready to dive in and conquer the code? 💪 The 6th digit awaits those brave enough to accept the challenge 🚀.

Good luck 🍀, and may the best coder win! 🏅👨‍💻👩‍💻

PROGRAM 1:


#include <stdio.h>

// Function prototypes
int function2(int);

// Call function2 from this file
int function1(int value) {
    printf("In function1: Value is %d\n", value);
    return function2(value + 1); // Calling function2
}

// Entry point
int main() {
    int initial_value = 5; // Starting value
    int key = function1(initial_value);
    printf("The final key is: %d\n", key);
    return 0;
}

PROGRAM 2:

#include <stdio.h>

// Function prototypes
int function3(int);

// Call function3 from this file
int function2(int value) {
    printf("In function2: Value is %d\n", value);
    return function3(value * 2); // Calling function3
}

PROGRAM 3:


#include <stdio.h>

// Function prototypes
int function1(int);

// Call function1 from this file
int function3(int value) {
    printf("In function3: Value is %d\n", value);
    return value % 10; // Final calculation of the key
}

		Final Clue:: Last but not Least this time I really hidden them in the realm of colors, potraits and Landscapes in the Master File
		So I am sure u not gonna crack it up 😜😜😜😜😜😜
